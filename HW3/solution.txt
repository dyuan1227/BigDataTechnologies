There are three python files in this homework. To run each file, simply run
python p1.py
python p2.py
python p3.py

The first python file will generate a pdf file of the running time. We can see that the two graphs look close. The algorithm graph of my program is better than O(nlogn).

The second python file will import the function from the first file.

Both the second and third python file take care of the insensitive cases.
